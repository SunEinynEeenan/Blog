      ∆ ∆ ∆  As i listen to an extended Radio Play of a Cumbia rendition of Hotline Bling @ a coffeeshop in my hometown,  I also am reading the Lightness lecture in Italo Cavino’s 6 memos for the next millenium, in between compulsive email and other communication checks.

      I admire the indirect persistance of Perseus. All things seem Gorgon(s) to me in many moods. I love that Medusa’s Gorgon head becomes Perseus’ constant companion, performing unexpected acts of magikal beauty, as well as the expected turning-people-to-stone business.
      For this next batch of songs — whose explusion has been interrupted by my tendonitis symptoms from the compressed nerves in my neck/shoulders — i will try to remind myself to jump over the tombs. This is NOT my home. It is theirs. I think i could be considered an Averroist, but the label Animism suits me much better. i experience daily changes and new Atavisms, maybe i am instead an Atavist. it makes things very disorienting.

      i hold on to feelings about past collaborator’s desire to erase others from the collaborative work. it must have a lot to do with being young and insecure but it’s always disturbing. It an interesting expression of pwr structures — as both a product and reforcement of them. the worst combo of perpetual injury (past tense) and injury (present tense)

            Sadly, this blog was started the night i learned that my Snail friend Yael had died.
            She was a beautiful Golden Mystery Snail that loved song, kale, and Gas-based water transit.
            We shared a love for things that are blanched.
            Although I will not be able to be at the service tonight at 7:30p in Oberlin Ohio, I am sending
            Yael's housemates -- Kat Mazur, Julie Bodian, and Yehudit Bodian-Mazur -- much Love.
      <br>  <img class="yael" src="yael.jpg" width="50%" height="auto"">

      <br>  <br> Yael will make a fantastic Cosmic Snail. The world can always use one as Golden as she.
