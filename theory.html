  maj 6/9 is a major chord based on fourths from the 3rd instead of 3rds

  minor ii v i (rootless voicings)

  ii - (g) f (a) Bb Db
  V alt - (c) e g# Bb D#
  i - (f)  d g ab c



  Tritone sub doesnt reference just the V
  	it’s temporary tonicizng a tritone away
  		in F
  			u can ii V in B and then just resolve to F
  				ive been just subbing the V dominant but that’s so basic!


  go up minor 3rds in dim(maj7) — super rad

  minor 6/9 add 11 — ab bb bnat db f
  	Eb7 / abminor

  maj #11 voicing
  	1 3 #4 (cluster) 7 9

  guitar is 6 monophonic synths whose ranges overlap



  its not you its the time


  chris writes melodies first

  he never worries about pushing away from a key center

  “slip center tonality” — htings can modulate . he modulates a lot by a little (like a half step or something). he didnt treat it like a modulation ‘the portion in B just kinda blurs and ends in C’


  Using [ I7 to I ] as a [ V to I ]


  selling things that are dissonant as consonaant
  	if by tone, voice leading, treating it “gently like its beautiful” (like a cluster — “no don’t worry, this is beautiful”)


  all interval tetrachords (jimi hendrix chord and all its inversions is one) as being balanced — 1 of every interval to infinity


  “overtone scale”  — lydian dominant
  	to Chris’ True Overtone Scale (schoenberg too) —  13th partial is closer to b6 than 6th ((but all ppl say its 6th))
  		1 2 3 #4 5 b6 b7 1 (includes cluster)
  			has 1 of all all interval tetrachords in it
  				just 1 major and 1 minor chord
  		check out 2nd and 5th mode

Air Max Nov. 9 2021 Lesson Q & A Responses

  Here are the notes I wrote to the two questions you asked earlier:

  I would like to explore workflow & approach. For example: for years I have been programming sounds from scratch using soft synths but I would love to hear/see how you achieve the quality with what you make! My friends and I work a lot of techniques out for ourselves, but it would be enlightening to see how you make sounds I really like without speculation or silly Reddit threads inbetween!
  - I’m a preset junkie, from which I tweak and then do a lot of sculpting/shaping.
  - I favour processes with a stochastic element, finding tools that have interesting sonic properties but that I’m not fully in control of, per se. I also like plugins with simple interfaces that really do *a thing* when I mess with the controls.
  - Some useful shaping tools are Saturn, max for live LFOs, manipulator for formant shifting, convolution reverbs, valhalla, decapitator, microshift, envelope followers, gating plugins, multi FX plugins like Glitch.
  - I like to have a mix of tools I know really well to help problem solve or quickly achieve a desired outcome, but also tools I don’t know so well that will surprise and challenge me.
  - I bounce to audio and resample frequently. It helps with CPU but also forces me to make decisions, commit, move on.
  - Bass I think of in layers: sub, which I keep very simple, then ‘mid’ bass layers that are often wider, more organic or unruly. The mid bass could be a different synth or the same synth duplicated and then heavily filtered and processed.
  - I use randomisable reaktor patches a lot, bouncing out sounds that I think have promise and then comprehensively tagging them so I can find them later. I also do this to recycle stems from failed sketches/ projects. That way when I work on new ideas and decide that I need a certain ingredient, I can first look through these premade elements and potentially find something that works well, before having to go about making that element from scratch.
  - I do a lot of parallel processing. This is useful to preserve the dynamics of the original signal while bolstering/ sculpting/ complexifying it. I think it’s critical to build relationships between sounds in a track, parallel processing is a powerful tool for this.
  - Other relationships I like to think about are call and response, and creating / simulating causal links from one sound to another (sidechaining is an example, but also having one sound flow into another, or having different sounds go through the same grouped processing or send)
  - Tune percussion to allow it to be melodic as well as rhythmic
  - Use track delays to find / tweak grooves
  - Use predelay on reverbs to preserve transients on percussion
  - Use delay instead of reverb for spatiality. Big un-EQ’d reverbs eat up space quickly. But if used sparingly they can be a wonderful wet contrast to dry elements.
  - If you’ve dialled in values for predelays, reverb lengths / sizes, velocities, etc; put an LFO on those parameters to modulate the value just slightly as the track goes along. This can help create more of a live feel especially for percussion.
  - Slaps / tight convolutions help make sounds more dimensional
  - Do what sounds good to you
  - Monitor in many environments you know well, and try not to make excuses to yourself if something isn’t hitting right
  - Make it slap in the mix, don’t rely on mastering. Mastering then becomes a bonus round rather than a problem solving space
  - The only thing that matters is what comes out of the speakers
  - Dynamics
  - References

  I also would love to hear your experiences around shepherding electronic music from the idea phase to the finished phase! Normal ‘artistic process’ questions….
  - I usually start with rhythm, occasionally something else. Sometimes I have a concept for a main part of a track or a breakdown that I try to articulate, but often I start with something more or less random and see where it takes me.
  - I build a loop and keep throwing stuff at it until I have a fairly fully formed ‘drop’ part. I need to be dancing in my seat. The more ideas the better at this stage, after arranging you can be more discerning about where certain ideas should feature or not, allowing different parts to 'solo' throughout the arrangement.
  - Then I copy and paste all of that material backwards and forwards in the timeline and subtract / vary elements to start thinking about an arrangement.
  - I love creating fucked up breakdowns that feel like a derailment, but also retain a thread of rhythm or continuity to draw the listener along
  - A 2nd drop can contain some ideas from the original loop sketch that didn’t make their way into the first drop, or there is a shift in groove, or maybe some elements are cycled out and replaced with something else, or a melodic line is expanded, etc.
  - There aren’t rules tho, arrangements can also be a long slow build in intensity with some kind of culmination, or jumping from an A section to a B section, or something else entirely.
  - The best tracks are ones where the bulk of the track gets written in one sitting, so there is a snowballing of ideas and everything feels like one exploration of a thought.
  - Sometimes I can help myself progress with an idea I got stuck on by putting it away for a long time til I forget about it completely, then returning to it later with fully objective ears. But also lots of ideas never get past a sketch, so I delete them.
  - 90 - 95% finished is good enough, the last 5% to perfection can take 95% of the time, it can be better to bounce a track and get it out into the world than to make it *perfect*
  - A good idea that is not perfectly realised is better than a bad idea that is perfectly realised.

08/12/2021 Seiya-Murai Song analysis

  0/1 Angel TRACK 09:

  full unison
  machine drums — kick not super up front.
  	mono but roto toms are L/R

  chords follow rhyhtm of melody (not hitting constant rhythm like 1/4ths or anything)

  Chorus Legato, verses stacatto




  0/1 Angel TRACK 10:
  chords being vamped in intro
  	guitar and bass harmonizing a melody

  verse
  	drums
  	voice
  	bass
  	strings come in on 2nd time thru

  chorus
  	chords in strings

  MELODY
  	Stay SUPER Simple in F and f min and have chords modulate
  		phrasing alternating b/w major and minor, chords accomodating
  			verse melody in the 1-5 range, chorus goes up to the 5/6 range
  	bass motion — I bVII vi bVI turnaround: bVI bVII


  vi bVI vi


  BON VOYAGE

  for excitement
  snare rolls center (military style)
  ride and crashes on side (very complex cymbal patterns)
  fx gestures with video game sounding square wave plucks
  glide bass1


  **************************************



  The Sato Shrug (Smooth) //  The Hiroshi Hump (sensodyne — delicate but sensual)

  ii-7 V7 IImaj7





  Bill Wurtz Shrug

  I vi11 IImaj7…. V7 I
  	walk up from 5 of ii up to 3rd of IImaj7 is key to the sound

  Turnaround

  IV iv- iii7 vi7 		((ii V I))



  adding sections in just different far away key (bridge or verse)— adds interest
  	going from G to Eb major for example
  		modulating by thrids is good to add interest — traditional jazz feel


  HE USES SATO SHRUG
  	for splash chords always put 9 or something in top voice! voicing is soooo important
  		use extensions of Vs to project where youre going (sato shrug add the 6 of the V because thats the 9 of the IImaj 7)

  think of simplifing chords by stacking triads
  	great sus is just the diatonic chord above


  start a phrase and have to modulate to proper key
  	Bb a-7 d7 gmaj7 (from mt st helens)

  every V is an 11 (add 9 and 11) and 13 for special times

  a lot of IV/V
  	5 in bass 451 in RH






  diatonic chords with 9ths — let extreensions be part of hte chord u resolve to
  	tropes
  		like I, iii, 4, 6 , 5

  			voicing for sus 1 458

  resolve a thing with new hgiher voicing embellishment but with a new bass
  	resolve F#7/C# to Emaj7/F#
  		bass is doing ii V in B but RH Is doing V7 —> IV

  plagal cadence is good for riffy things

  for surprise, plane 13 chords or something ese jazzy and hten hit a splash chord that goes to I

  enclosures in bass fill to give it that dirty loops feel — borrow from other modes or just go chromatic. throwing b7 in there in a major key is good

  V/V to Vmaj7. brief tonicizing

  nice even voicings, whole/half steps in mid voices or top

  end on sus chords (2 and 4 or 11 or 13)
  	lot of quartal voicings




  The Elliott Smith Chord

  II major (maj7 or 7 or 9 or 13) at end of a phrase or as the climax of a lyric
  	it signals a change of tone
  		example ::: Imaj7 IImaj7 IVmaj7
  			tends to go to IV
