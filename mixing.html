	retune @ 20
	everything else 0
	target with midi

		amp amt 10
		formant amt 70
	soprano


echoboy 1/4 note delay
	 not filtered
	very low mix
	a bit of feedback

valhalla vintage verb

like ian kirkpatrick sometimes they just print delays and then u just have it
	its a lot easier to see

</div>




<div class="pre">

<u>Ian Kirkpatrick Charli XCX Move Me stream notes</u>


softclip pro at like 30%

just cut those peaks right off


super compressed doubles

turn each 1/4 into 1/8ths by speeding it up



automate la 2a peak reduction to control dynamic of the vocal. uncompressed sounds amateurish. but mixing between un and super compressed (like 10+ even 20db GR) really gives it that charli sound
	when on like 5 to 7db GR
	automate down lead going into the compressor to take compression away

de ess HARD then add harmonic excitment (gem dopamine or other) and boost to highs to bring them back and now it has high end but not sharp to the ear

parallel compression with dry wet knob

pultec boosting 16k



instead of taking OUT information, turn down the WHOLE THING then just bring up the frequencies u want

</div>

<div class="pre">
  <u>Disclosure (idk which one but one of the ones on twitch) Stream Notes</u>

158ms mono delay on vox instead of reverb— low mix
1/8th note ping pong also relaly quiet

dont autotune harmonies
have one harmony act different to get the voicings be cool
going up and done fourths is very r&b 90s

waves s1 on synths

  <u>Bob Horn Vocal Mixing Zine 1</u>


  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdOey83QIYI&ab_channel=ProAudioFiles

  fast release on vocal compressor puts the vocal way in front of the mix, slowing down the release pushes the vocal backwords!
  	medium to slow attack (just barely >3 in bob horn’s example)

  with 4 ratio, u can go to 10 db gain reduction with a fast release (allt he way to 1)

  the PROBLEM with a fast release if ure doing a lot of GR, as soon as theyre done singing a word, all the mouth sounds will come up in volume!
  	on the verse, horn is doing 4-7 GR, softer
  		on the chorus it goes up to 10 bc the singer sings louder
  			the breaths are 10 db louder
  			u hand automate the breaths out (it gets the extra personality from the compression — that britney vibe the way it comes out front — the fast release is SO nice)


  76 noise off
  he’s using only waves plugins



  DE-ESS

  he prefers over-deessing !!! i always avoid this

  he grabs the s’s and t’s a lot , until the vocal sounds smooth — they wont sound offensive on ANYTHNIGN
  	then he brightens the whole track later
  		doing upwards of 3-6, spikes of 10 GR on the S’s


  for paralel comp bus, he has the comp go into a limiter ! so smart! just smash it
  	same attack and release (he seems to use the same settings for everyon just abt, only changes attack a tiny bit) and a hotter input to push ti more (7ish GR is what he has
  		use prefader for parallel comp! but make sure to copy volume automation!
  			u dont want the fader rides to pump the compressor but u still want those breathes outta there!


  when he tracks he wants it to sound as perfect as possible — inspiring, almost pre-mixed
  	he doesnt want it to be ‘transparent’ to eq later
  		he wants to inspire ppl with just the tracking
  			he doesnt track with compression much
  				he EQs tho!

</div>



<div class="pre">
HG 2 Black Box zine 1

  saturation knob is for parallel send PRE MAIN Processing to beef up a certain range u want more of.
Lacking warmth? hit the signal with some parrallel low freq based tube distortion THEN process! really does wonders


pentode — rounded
triode — odd harmonics , a bit harder edge

these run in series so u can push and pull!

air band is post saturation — post saturation EQ to 10khz

menu items—
calibration — dark , bright, normal , more of a subtle adjustment
density — applies gain compensation for the gain
	it adjusts the pent and tri together while compensating the gain
	good for tweaking after u like what u’re getting iwth the knobs

meters — vu = rms ; ppm = peak

u can hold shift to make fine adjustments

<u>2021 DMG Limitless Limiter Notes Zine</u>

  distortion vs softening the transient

  lookahead —> less = more distortion, higher = softening the transient

  dynamic —> how much handled by gentle first limiter, or wseocnd more aggressive
  			dyn at zero is more aggressive limitign

  knee —> 0db for most things

  weight —> a way into the multiband limiting
  		negative values, try to preserve as much bass as possible and GR in highs
  		positive values, retain hi frequencies and use lower bands for GR
  			from -400 - 400
  				at 0 it tries to do it equally — but u’ll lose bass
  				-100, -150 often for transparency but loudness build

  release shape —> how u wan tthe release curve to be shaped
  		100% = fast curve
  		0% = slow curve
  			chosen by ear
  				to help with pumping it seems
  					prob depends on the type of transient s in ur track
  						ag style super fast kick? 808s?


  go to setup and choose band strips

<div class="pre">



  spike stent videos / lecture notes

  mutes vocals
  listenss to insturmental
  then starts by getting the drums right


  parallel drums bus
  eq’s (hype in the high end) into a few compressors and overcompresses
  to add hitd
  he doesnt like subtle compressor
  he’ll also add in samples to fatten up kicks etc —different for different sections
  push up the parallel busses for choruses


  a lot of time he only used delays
  reverbs would wash out
  delay would have a clean depth, no wash
  he uses delays a lot more than reverbs


  he uses imac speakers to check his mixes a lot


  mono speaker is good for balancing vocals




  PROJECT LAYOUT


  drums
  bass
  guitars
  keys
  strings
  brass
  bg vox
  lead vox

  instrument bus so the vox can get their own processing
  then the master bus will be fitting the vox mix and the instrument mixes together





  OTT at 2% depth at end of master bus :O
  	he does this with a lot of outboard gear

  he always has an eq, a comp, and a limiter on master bus
  	he wants to not over-eq every channel
  		gets a basic mix/balance then puts master on to give it a general warmth


  he ALWAYS gets chorus cool
  	he always does a master fader push in the chorus!
  		his version of the 60s trick of speeding up the chorus a little bit to make it more exciting
  		probably with do a drum sub and an element with really ‘wicked up’ eq and compression but at low mix %


  he always does a compression on master bus
  	really hyped up and a lot of distortion pushing things

  **with in the box mixing you really have to push the technology to get an exciting mix


  add 1.5 k to bass for a punch!
  200 hz is one of his favorites lol for bass


  keep bottom end punchy (short kicks)


  if timing doesn’t feel right then change it!!! he changes timing ALL THE TIME
  	never be afraid to change a thing that sounds wrong
  		show yourself, be yourself
  			someimtes it’s a bit scary but go for it
  				dont be afraid — always go for it!!

  he uses a lot of compression to bring out diction that ppl are saying (stormzy)
  	desser
  	compressor (A LOT of compression)
  	eq ( ssl channel strip) with REALLY pushed up top end
  	deesser to catch issues the first one isnt catching and to tame the bright eq boost
  		A LOT OF automation where breaths are automated out. he doesnt take them out to keep it sounding human


  he listens to the rough mix and asks “is there something here moving me?”


  in this video he has a ssl channel at the end (even after another ssl strip) adding 9db on a shelf at 11khz
  	“ive never been shy about using a lot of top end”
  		around 10k can been a little dangerous depending on the singer so u might need another deesser


  the timing is really really important. most of whwat he did was moving around the timing
  	chopped up the line and scooted the words over by samples to get it feeling right in the beat



  ***** if the drums dont sound good the mix is gonna be crap ***** — what he’s learned in his career


  “i like depth, dpeth of vision”


  PHASE

  he checks everything for a phase
  	line up the sample and then flip phase — if the lowend disappears then u had it right
  		sometimes the bass just shoots out and u fixed it congrats!
  	he’ll check kit too!
  		phase of toms and snare with the kick?!!
  		overhead is often out of phase with the toms!

  he’ll play with phase too
  	keybaord sound , mult one side, flip phase of one of the ears to push it stereo



  he only does additive eq hahahahha
  	so sick


  he love 200hz on drums
  1.5k on vox

MALAMENTE JAYCEN Joshua


for imporntatn elements that share freq range iwth vocal, add autopan to give it movement and get it out of hte way


throw la -2a on synth but dont compress it at all. just for texture. pablo did that for main synth on malamente


20, 40 , or 60 ms of predelay. to make vocalist sound in your face and intimate, the first thign that hits you is a dry vocal. you ccannnnn put a slapback on it but he hits u with that dry first!


itb vocal chain:
	lofi — 9 times out of 10 he bit crushes it & adds dist.— this helps vocals that are too thin
		doesnnt bit crush when its already been compressed
	rcomp (this is the one that changes based on vocal performance)
	proq
		money is int he crisp highs, but the soul of vocals are in the lows. up front heavy
		he unmudies the mix btween 200 and 1k but boosts 84 wher there is nothing but it adds first part of syllables back
	mc4040
		multiband compression.
		tightens the plosive and everything!
		makes the vocal really consistant
		really hitting 6db gr on a lot of stuff. attack 2.5 , release 250. comp 2:1
			the lower the vocals, the lower you mix sounds. Dynamics come from “Moments”, reverb front ot back moments. REverb bursts “moments” as front- to-back panner for special moments that make the consistnet vocal feel dynamic/// to introduce movements
	pro q
	cla voclas
		using spank compress
		Alt is to use Parralel Comp. It’s super important!! amkes it fat!
		uuse “stereo” or “spreader” to make it wider
	c6
		surgical Tools!
		u can use FF MB
		find trouble spots
		Q at 60… super surgical
		“never look at the meters”
			he’s redlining lol

Reid Stefan Vocal Production Tips and Sends(really good and implementable) jan 2021


  \on channel

  gain
  low cut and low shelf
  leveling compressor (relatively fast, not extreme compression staying in realm of -5 or -6 gr is good here. evening out peaks. ——- feel free to add some light saturation here or use hardware emu to get some)
  — opt saturaiton (can just use saturating analog eq or compressor emulations


  \sends


  1. parallel comp — fattenening (SLAM it. doesnt have to be slow or opto. if you want faster just have at 20:1 or higher) u shoudnt even have to eq this if the vocal is well eq’d and u’ve chosen your attack and release well. (((( if beginning of words sound too muffled, lengthen attack; if beggining of words too loud, increase the attack; if the ends of words — s’s and the breaths — are too loud speed up the release;

  2. 1/4 note delay (eq’d and modulated — detuned and stereoized — to get out of vocal — cuold be flange, chorus, or ensemble etc). bandpassed in delay plugin

  3. long delay (1/2 note or more). bandpassed in plugin and do what u gotta do to it

  4. Long reverb (reflective/metallic. helps ‘fill in gaps’ with unnoticable ambience — silver verb metallic stairwell

  5. short verb — space designer price room in room verbs

  6. slap delay — mono to the right (elie’s Wu Tang Slap; or stereo for wide slap (they can be widely off like 60ms in one ear and 100 in other) — -add distortion to your slap!! adds distrtion to ur vocal while keeping vocla clean
  		LIFE HACK (dist on stereo slap)
  			use Clip Distortion “Bright Distorion” preset
  				U dont hear it but it adds so much life to mono vocal somhow


  BRING IN THESE FX OVER THE COURSE OF THE SONG!
  	DOnt just set it and forget it!
  		it’s about making the vocals ‘dance’

<b>Mix With The Masters Notes -- Finneas and Jaycen Joshua 01.07.2021</b>

finneas — make bass line singable too



puts a channel eq with -dbs to get down to like -7db peak
	lol gain staging isnt real



sample delay — 442 samples on one side


bg harmonies are always doubled and panned opposite.
	sometimes even whisper
		or singing it differently. always doubled

edits out “S”s on bg vocals
cut out low range
and compresses


“moving everything else out of the way of the vocals”


factory Compressor in Logic
	Platinum Digital Setting
		15 ms attack
		51 ms release (but with auto release on ?)
		6:1 ratio
		0.7 knee
		no input or makeup gain
		threshold -28/-29 —> idk how much db of compression there is

Pop filter


she does most of the takes sitting on a couch


“there are so mnay professionals who will tell you that what youre doing is wrong. as long as you like it then youre good.”



“Fake master” for ppl to listen :::: TR5 Suite — Only Classic 1 preset
	but takes it off when senidng to mix engineer








16k  up like 1 or 2 db sleft

nice sounding compressor hitting 1 db to warm it up

whne sending mix to clients he slaps on L2 with -5b and ceiling of -0.2
	if you can take off 100db and the transients are still there and dynamics are still good then that’s great!
		if pushed too hard it turns intoa  cheese gratrer

don’t worry about lights and meters except for when you come back and sum

kick at -5 or -4 at most to not have too high of a voltage
	tries not to soft saturate too much. tries to just saturate certain things
		ppl get one peak and ppl turn teh whole mix down! just leave it if it sounds good!
			look at aerage peak
			he tends to end with -3ish average

tries to mix as fast as possible — tries not to talk himself out of ideas



stacked 2 valhalla vintage verbs, taking out low end with Pro Q3 (keeping slope from 5k down at -3 and a bump even lower at 200)  bc vintage verb is bassy
	uses m/s processing to erase the Center to leave room for only Lead Vox!!!


Vox Comp send —> Rcomp to Vingtage Verb Santuary setting with a 40ms decay

tends to use predelay on vocals so it sounds like the vocalist is right in your face
	he uses H delay on 1/64
		no filtering and no feedback; pingpong

to create interesting reverbs
	predelay
	verb
	delay with feedback for some effect
	verb
	comp
	pro q

takes all vox and runs thru soothe

make “moments”
	changes temperature/scene of section by makign these moments around words/phrases

he has his own early reflections sends (how close is she to me?) and late reflection sends (what room is she in?)
	he only used early refectiosn for

label and color code things (make color coding consistent for all projects)— makes it simple and free flowing

rosalia — v lo fi drums  — snare not much highend
	layers with rim so if you want more attack u just mix rim in higher!

common for latin producers to have beat layered iwth 2 track of a loop/sample beat
	pablo filtered it: no low end or highend. just filling in mids

use izotope to analyze certain tracks to se how processed it is

uses rcomp as a gain thing — whne compressing — to keep fader at 0

The LESS INFORMATION YOU SEND TO YOUR TWO BUS, THE LOUDER U CAN BE
	SO CARVE, CARVE, CARVE EVerything down to it’s eseential ranges
		keep it musical — dont take things away just to take them away
			but take away what yo dont need

usse tube screamer as distortion
	for top end of 808
		he isolates the sub range, puts thru tube scremer, isolates the high end distortion area!

removes sub 32 hz

6db to 8db of GR is sweet spot to create knock/transient
		uses rcomp at 48ms attack
			5ms of release (fastest as possible)
u dont need 2 transients at the same time, ramp upt he other hits

to get texture and weight — CLA Mixdown GLUE and drive sliders ((parallel comp)
	he doesnt even move the knobs, he jsut turns them al to “on” and turns down output — the needles are barely moving

2 ps22 spreaders in series to image it in this crazy way. feels liek sample delay but maxed out, gives an element (like perc) excitement\

space and clarity are everything
	if theres reverb clouding, use gate to take it away. reverb is from to back

A lot of saturation on the sum bus of the steel drums. He even uses Lofi and knocks it downt o 16bit sample rate and adds a bit of distortion and saturation there. then little radiator from sound toys again,,, “make it sound more analogue” into CLA mixdown (he pushes up slides a tiny bit) into RC20 (“im gonna help make your record cool” plugin; it  just adds texture; uses noise, wobble, distort (tubepair), and magnetic flutter— wobble super common in rap music now). rc20 drives the mids and sounds bad without it!. the flutter and noise and wobble are all felt not heard …. at about 11% blend in.


“sometimes u have to make something ugly before yo make it beutiful again”

he tends to lower bitrate o 15 when he wants to add texture
	for the “tu por ti” rosalia loop/hook he lowed down sampl rate, ran thru CLAmixdown. thats it
		puts a tiny bump on 2k
			withotu that stuff its too clean. it gives it texture and makes it sit better!!!

little vocal synth things that hapepn once
	ear candy that makes ppl wanna listena gain
		“dr Dre theory”

Max Martin had white noise as a track!
	when digital recording goes silent, it gives it the noise floor bc otherwise it feels weird
		Dave Pensado calls it “the beach”
			it also sweetens reverb trails

Everytime he uses CLA mixdown its a inthebox replacement for outboard preamp—>parallel comp

when u parralel compress it takes away all transients, you choose what part of the low end that you want to boost… great to bring out a frequency. he really relies on it

Waves MV2
	low boost at 34
	High boost @ -34
	use output knob starting off and add in until theres some glue or heavines
		puts this on the whoel drums. makes it heavy. makes it ouder without ading too much voltage

the less your stereo has to work, the beter your record sounds

SSL “Crosseye” dr dre preset  — for “transformer”/exciting transients texture… put a saturator before it to add some harmonics. have this be a send to parallel texture it. u can filter out everything below like 2k if all you want is the high end transients. its up to what you need
	attack the slowest, release the fastest
	take b/w4 to  8db off
	ratio 2

compress something then add saturation to “add those transients back”


drum buss emulation
8 NLS plugins in a row :O :O :O
	Whiteboy Steve invented it
		doess soooo much
			i think it’s jsut adding that default texture until its loud enoguh to hear
			it’s a feeling, depth
				it wanders a little bit in pan, so u have to pull it back in to center


hold and release of drum gate at 1s to just liek not turn it on and off while the track is playing. only when its cut out for a while

everything under 61hz mono downt the middle thru m/s processing

for making things louder, adding harmoincs — HG 2
	read the manual on what pentode and triode mean
		meters dont move but it sounds like 4db ouder!!


itb vocal chain:
	lofi — 9 times out of 10 he bit crushes it & adds dist.— this helps vocals that are too thin
		doesnnt bit crush when its already been compressed
	rcomp (this is the one that changes based on vocal performance)

THESE ARE ALL SETUP AS A TEMPLATE. HE OFTEN WONT USE A PLUGIN FOR PARTICULAR MIXES
IF HE NEEDS SOMETHING FUN HE MAKES IT A SEND￼



^^^^^^ ad lib “Vibe” reverb


Ad libs add the depth — as moments — reverbed out!
	doesn’t cloud the mix bc itonly comes in for moments


All Vox sum into Soothe
	take micro harshnesses and fixes it


Adlibs
	crushed, chopped and screwed and reverbed
		adds so much depths

High end is a distance indicator
	front ot back tool is EQ too
		if u dont do reverb until mixing pass


Bass and drums thru 1073 Neves
	everything else thru 9k SSL Hi Fidelity


His go to weapon to eq a sound is parralel comp, adding harmonics and saturation!

You better have better taste/flavour than technique
	turning knobs until it feels right

Lavry Gold converter magical frequency lol. he bounces down to 2 tracks thru Lavry Gold
	if u push it, it gets heavy
		it has a soft saturation button


DONT BOUNCE TO DISK
	i dont trust the ppl who make the algorithm
	make a mster bus to print tracks to live

test mix on iphone

“Mixing isn  for the artist — it’s to sell the record”


he listens thru once
	“omg this is going to be the biggest record ever”
		this one will play in clubs
		or this one will be everywhere —
			doesnt talk himself out of thinking

Theyre coming to you for the taste




MALAMENTE

20, 40 , or 60 ms of predelay. to make vocalist sound in your face and intimate, the first thign that hits you is a dry vocal. you ccannnnn put a slapback on it but he hits u with that dry first!



light Flange Vocal Send (“Air France”)
	Microshift “lead spread mixed”
	Rcomp (Attack and Rel as fast as it goes 4:1 ratio to get rid of any peaks
	take out low mids so u r not adding boominess/muddiness/proximity effect


a  lot of things comign out of altanta use rverb
	its nice and layered — esp for background vox

throw la -2a on synth but dont compress it at all. just for texture. pablo did that for main synth on malamente

subbass — roll off all upper hamonics. run thru distortion to create harmonics. mix into original signal

for imporntatn elements that share freq range iwth vocal, add autopan to give it movement and get it out of hte way

“front to back panner” — short room reverb (i think being automated) on important element to subtley make it feel like its dancing aroudn you

for pop 808 cut at 24hz

drawing in attack volume automation is drawing in sidecahin compression! So much control with so little work! :) fun technique


kick click
kick low/body


he tends to dip b/w 900 and 2.5k the mids. get rid of harshness. obvi track dependent tho


fix a not optimal mic with 1 band of multiband compression, compressing that area to add harmonics to the section it wasnt picking up great. can do this to the body (low) of a vocal if you need more soul



in order to allow for variation, he has verse vocals and chorus vocals each going to their own submix bus, which are both going to the all vocals bus (which tends to just have soothe on it)



put rbass on drums to be uadioble on smaller speakers — like -13 ish intensity mayb eup to -10


3.5k seems to be the ‘expensive’ hi end freq


ns1 Noise suppressor Waves — fucks up the fidelity. sounds GREAT. he uses it on tambor on malamente. makes the clicky loop beefy and warm


when pararallel compressing, think “am i trying to sharpen up the transients or thicken up the sound?”
	if sharpen transients (drums, certain vox) the slow attack — filter out lows
	if fatten, fast attack



sometimes u gotta talk yourself out of doing the stuff you always do
	just let it breathe and be itself s

“Music Comp” — to brighten loop or something, give it life — pararlel comp mv2 and filter out low lows (150 and up)


PS22 grand piano preset
	but tighten low end so its dwn the middle and not to the side


Cla vocals Top at 1


vocal cahin always

lofi
	to add tiny saturation or texture (by lowering bits to 15 or lower even!)
rvox
	to tame proximity effect — he says this is a slept on plugin
pro q
	to boost or dip a problem
pro q
	To do ur ‘vocal eq’ . he will low shelf up to 4 k and down many many db (like over 6) and then turn back up with the gain knob. this adds that hi end shine

multi band compression
	it follows the emotion of the vocal\
cla vocals


MIX BUS
multiband exciter
multiband compression
.1 to imager on top band (2.5k and up) of full mix ot add excitement . .1 is enough or u’l ruin your mix iwth too much phasiness
